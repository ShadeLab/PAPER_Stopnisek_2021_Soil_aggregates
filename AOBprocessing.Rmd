This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Cmd+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r}
track %>%
  gt(rowname_col = "sampleID") %>%
  tab_stubhead(label = "Sample ID") %>%
  tab_header(
    title = md("**Read processing Statistics**"),
    subtitle = "Using DADA2 package in R and amoA AOB amplicons") %>%
  tab_row_group(
    group = "Montcalm",
    rows = 1:21) %>%
  tab_row_group(
    group = "Saginaw Valley",
    rows = 22:42) %>%
  cols_label(
    input = "Input",
    filtered = "Quality\nfiltered",
    denoisedF = "Denoised forward",
    denoisedR = "Denoised reverse",
    merged = "Merged",
    nonchim = "Without chimera")
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Cmd+Option+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Cmd+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file). 

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.
