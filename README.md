# Soil particle size, soil chemistry and ammonia oxydizers

This is the repository for the project "Ammonia oxydizing communities are more impacted by the soil nitrogen species than by the soil particle size".

We hypothesized that the co-occurrence of ammonia oxydizing archaea (AOB) and ammonia oxydizing bacteria (AOB) in soil environment is due to the soil chemical and size heterogeneity which they preferentially and selectively occupy.
 

We found that:

1. Microbial richness is influenced by the soil particle size  
2. Chemical properties of soil particles are very different and are site dependent
3. Ammonia oxydizing communities are influenced by the ammonium concentrations and not soil article sizes. 
4. Richness of AOA>AOB 
5. Soil particle surface area
