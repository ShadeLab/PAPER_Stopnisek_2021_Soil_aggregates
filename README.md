# Soil Aggregates

This is the repository for the project "Ammonia oxydizing communities are more impacted by the soil nitrogen species than by the soil particle size"

We found that:

1. Microbial richness is influenced by the soil particle size  
2. Chemical properties of soil particles are very different and are site dependent
3. Ammonia oxydizing communities are influenced by the ammonium concentrations and not soil article sizes. 
4. Richness of AOA>AOB
