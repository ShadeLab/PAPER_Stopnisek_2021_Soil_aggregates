# Soil particle size, soil chemistry and ammonia oxydizers

This is the repository for the project *"Ammonia oxidizing communities are more impacted by the soil nitrogen species than by the soil particle size"*.

We hypothesized that the co-occurrence of ammonia oxidizing archaea (__AOA__) and ammonia oxidizing bacteria (__AOB__) in soil environment is due to the soil chemical and size heterogeneity which they preferentially and selectively occupy.


We found that:

1. Microbial richness is influenced by the soil particle size  
2. Chemical properties of soil particles are very different and are site dependent
3. Ammonia oxidizing communities are influenced by the ammonium concentrations and not soil article sizes.
4. Richness of AOA>AOB
5. Soil particle surface area
