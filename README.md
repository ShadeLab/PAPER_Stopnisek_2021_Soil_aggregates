# Soil particle size, soil chemistry and ammonia oxidizers

This is the repository for the project *"Ammonia oxidizing communities are more impacted by the soil nitrogen species than by the soil particle size"*.

We hypothesized that the co-occurrence of ammonia oxidizing archaea (__AOA__) and ammonia oxidizing bacteria (__AOB__) in soil environment is due to the soil chemical and size heterogeneity which they preferentially and selectively occupy.
