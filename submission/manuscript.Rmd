## Abstract

## Introduction

Ammonia oxidation first step in nitrification carried out by archaea (AOA) and bacteria (AOB). Recently, a group of bacteria (i.e. comammox) has been described, known to perform complete nitrification. While little is known about the distribution of comammox organisms in the soil, we have a large number of studies investigating the environmental and evolutionary preferences of AOA and AOB in the soil environment.
AOA more abundant and active then AOB in soil
AOA have been shown to typically outnumber the abundance of AOB in natural soils, however this is not true for managed soils where nitrogen sources are usually added. AOA and AOB commonly compete for same resources, however research has shown that AOA 
This pattern is driven by the preference of AOA and AOB for same nitrogen sources but    


We hypothesized that the co-occurrence of ammonia oxidizing archaea (__AOA__) and ammonia oxidizing bacteria (__AOB__) in soil environment is due to the soil chemical and size heterogeneity which they preferentially and selectively occupy.

## Results
We found that:

1. Microbial richness is influenced by the soil particle size.  
2. Chemical properties of soil particles are very different and are site dependent.
3. Ammonia oxidizing communities are influenced by the ammonium concentrations and not soil article sizes.
4. Richness of AOA>AOB.
5. Soil particle surface area.
